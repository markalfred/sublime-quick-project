Sublime Quick Project
=====================

This Sublime Text plugin is dead simple.

It creates a `.sublime-project` file in the root of your currently-opened folder.
This way, you don't have to "Save Project As..." every time you start a new project.

Usage
-----
* Open a folder

* Command Palette -> Quick Create Project
or
* Project -> Quick Create Project
